# Code_Alpha_A-B_Testing_Analysis_FARYALSHAKEEL

Overview
This project involves A/B testing using control and test CSV files to compare the effectiveness of two different marketing strategies. The goal is to determine which technique leads to better conversion rates, making it an essential approach for data-driven decision-making. A/B testing is a fundamental concept that every data science professional should understand to optimize business outcomes.

Code Perspective
The code uses Python libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations, and SciPy for statistical analysis. It handles data cleaning, outlier detection, hypothesis testing (t-tests), and significance evaluation, providing insights into the performance of each strategy.
